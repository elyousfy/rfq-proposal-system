Your task is to extract all important requirements, constraints, and context from the RFQ documents provided.

Instructions:

    Work strictly within the provided RFQ text (do not invent details).

    Extract the following categories in detail:

        Objectives: The business/technical objectives the client wants to achieve.
        
        Deliverables: Specific outputs the vendor must provide (reports, systems, training, etc.).
        
        Constraints: Time, budget, resource, or technology limitations.
        
        Risks: Risks explicitly mentioned, or implied (tight deadlines, dependencies, compliance risks).
        
        Success Criteria: How the client will measure success (audit passed, uptime %, adoption rate, etc.).
        
        Stakeholders: Who is involved on the client side (roles, departments).
        
        Standards: All compliance standards, certifications, or regulations (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA).

        Scope: The expected scope of work (what needs to be delivered).

    CRITICAL: For each point you extract, you MUST include the source reference in the format:
    "Point description [Source: filename.pdf, page X]"
    
    Use the source information provided in the document metadata to identify where each requirement comes from.

    Include every explicit detail found in the RFQ.

    Format your output as JSON only, with one array of strings per field.
    Each string should include the source reference at the end.

    If a category is not mentioned, return an empty array ([]).
    
    Example format:
    {
      "objectives": [
        "Implement cloud migration strategy to reduce costs by 30% [Source: main_rfq.pdf, page 2]",
        "Achieve 99.9% uptime for critical systems [Source: technical_requirements.pdf, page 5]"
      ]
    }
